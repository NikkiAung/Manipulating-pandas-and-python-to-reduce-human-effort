# 📊 Manipulating Pandas and Python to Reduce Human Effort

## This project automates the process of extracting data from Excel files and filling customized templates to minimize manual effort. It ensures efficient handling of structured data, including batch lot numbers, color formulations, and vendor details, saving time and increasing accuracy.

### 🚀 Features

* 📑 Excel to CSV Conversion: Converts raw Excel data into structured CSV files.

* 🔍 RBQL Template Generation: Automatically creates RBQL templates for querying and transformation.

* 📋 Text Data Extraction: Reads structured data from text templates for processing.

* 📝 Excel Template Filling: Dynamically populates an Excel template with extracted and processed data.

* 📊 Multiple Output Generation: Number of output files corresponds directly to batch lot numbers in the input Excel file.
